# Elf

Elves are graceful, slender demi-humans with delicate features and pointy ears. Elves are known to use magic spells, but prefer to spend their time feasting and frolicking in wooded glades. They rarely visit cities of men. Elves are fascinated by magic and never grow weary of collecting spells or magic items. Elves love beautifully crafted items and choose to live an agrarian life in accord with nature.
