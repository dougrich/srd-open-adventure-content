# Lizardfolk

Lizardfolk are water-dwelling humanoids with the body of a man and the head, claws, scaly hide and tails of a lizard or serpent. Lizardmen make tribal nests in swamps, rivers and along seacoasts. Lizardfolk live in small tribes and care little for affairs of men or demi-humans. Most are a drab green or brown color, while others can be dramatically colorful: bright reds, yellow, blues and greens, like some other reptiles and serpents.
