# Troll

Trolls are a diverse sapient race that can be found in nearly any corner of the world. They walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Trolls can be staggeringly tall, lanky, and muscular with rubbery blue, green and mottled gray hides. Many trolls hold no loyalty other than to their tribe. Their long arms, strong legs and quick reflexes make them adept hunters.
