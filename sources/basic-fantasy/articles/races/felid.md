# Felid

Felids are several sub-races of feline catfolk. They are large bi-pedal humanoids with a feline head, claws, fur and tail. The colors and markings of their fur can vary greatly from one of a tiger, lion or leopard. Felids are very tribal, keeping few records of their past. They share a tight bond with one another and are ex-tremely loyal to their kin. Their focus and courage in battle is known in far away lands.
