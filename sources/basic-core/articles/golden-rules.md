# Golden Rules

Although the material in this book is referred to as rules, in reality they are more guidelines than rules. If, after playing the game for a while, you and the game's referee (referred to as a Game Master), decide to alter or add to the existing rule sets, feel free to do so. The rules listed here are to serve as a framework onto which you can build and craft your own imaginary worlds and adventures.

However there are a few Golden Rules that should be understood and followed above all other rules detailed in this book:

1.	If two rules directly or indirectly conflict, the more specific rule shall take precedence over the broader or more general rule.
2.	If an argument arises in which one party or player wishes to complete an action but another party or player does not believe the action is possible or in the spirit of the rules, and after much thoughtful debate, the default conclusion should be that the action cannot be completed.
3.	When dealing with numeral fractions, always round down to the nearest whole number.
4.	The game master has final say in all rules deliberations.
5.	The rules in this book are simply a framework, not scripture. Any part of the rules can be changed or neglected by the game master.
