# How To Use The Dice
When referring to dice, an abbreviation is often used. The first number in the abbreviation is the number of dice being rolled followed by the letter "d" (shorthand for "die" or "dice"), and then the number of sides the dice have. FOR EXAMPLE, "5d6" would mean to roll five six-sided dice and add the total of all the dice rolls together. If a plus ("+") or minus ("-") symbol, followed by a number, are present; this means to add or subtract the number from the overall total. FOR EXAMPLE, "1d6+3" would mean roll a six-sided die and add three to the result.

In OPEN ADVENTURE any action that has a possibility of failure that would carry with it significant consequence, such as a PC attempting a daring jump across a wide crevasse, can be resolved by rolling two six-sided dice of different colors (preferably one die being white and the other black). The white or lighter colored die represents positive numbers. The black or darker die represents negative numbers.

When a character's ability must be tested both dice are rolled at the same time but a player only needs to pay attention to the die that rolled the lowest number.

* If the lowest number rolled was on the white die, add the number to whichever ability is being tested.
* If the lowest number rolled was on the black die, subtract the number from whichever ability is being tested.
* If the two dice rolls are the same, then there is no lowest number and the skill tested is unmodified.

FOR EXAMPLE, a roll of 5 on the white die and a 2 on the black die would mean a result of -2 to a skill test. A roll of 1 on the white die and 1 on the black die would mean a result of +0 to a skill test. A roll of 1 on the white die and 3 on the black die would mean a result of +1 to a skill test.

Possible outcomes range from -5 to +5, with a statistical bias towards a roll of 0. This form of dice rolling is known as a Standard Roll throughout OPEN ADVENTURE. For an example of how dice rolls are used during game combat, see [Example Combat](#/reference/articles/basic/example-combat).

## Dice Alternatives

If only one six-sided die is available, roll the die twice and consider the first roll as the white die and the second roll as the black die.
If only a standard deck of playing cards are available, separate six suited cards ranging from ace through six. Separate another six suited cards (preferably of a different color) also ace through six. Shuffle the two sets of suits separately then draw the top card from each pile. Treat the number on the cards from the first suit as the white die roll. Treat the numbers on the cards of the second suit as the black die roll. Shuffle the cards into their original piles before reusing them in this manner.

If no materials are available, when a die roll is needed two players will count to three and in rock-paper-scissors fashion simultaneously reveal zero, one, two, three, four or five fingers each.

Subtract the lowest number of fingers revealed from the highest number of fingers revealed. This is the rolled number.

If the rolled number is not zero, the players make note of whether the current and previous numbers revealed were both even or odd numbers. If both were odd or even, the current rolled number is a positive number. If the current and previous numbers were even and odd, the currently rolled number is a negative number.

FOR EXAMPLE, two players reveal the numbers 1 and 4 simultaneously. The rolled number is 3 (4 - 1 = 3). Next, the players compare this number to the previous number rolled, which was a 5. Since the two numbers 3 and 5 are both odd, the rolled number becomes positive for a total of +3.
