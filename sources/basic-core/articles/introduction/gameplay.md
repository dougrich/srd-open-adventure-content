## Game Play
At the beginning of the game players enter into the scene. FOR EXAMPLE, a scene could begin in a dungeon on a far away moon or near a small hamlet. As the adventure unfolds; players will eventually meet non-player characters (NPCs) which they may talk to, avoid or fight. **Enemies** are any animal, person, monster or supernatural creature that is unfriendly towards the party and often wanting to fight the characters. An enemy may be anything from a ferocious dragon or alien mutant to an angry merchant. For game purposes any character that's not a player character (PC) is an NPC. Any NPC that is unfriendly or hostile towards a player character is an enemy.

When PCs meet up with or run into NPCs it is referred to as an **Encounter**. During a typical adventure player characters will also discover treasure, avoid dangers such as traps and encounter enemies. Often times the player characters will resort to fighting enemies. Such a fight is called **Combat**.

Throughout an adventure PCs try to gain experience to further advance their skills. Adventurers gain experience by earning **Experience Points (XP)** given to them by the GM based off how much treasure they find and the number of enemies they defeat in combat. Experience points gained from one adventure will be retained throughout future adventures. Eventually when a PC has earned enough XP they will advance in **Level**. There are a total of five levels a PC can attain in OPEN ADVENTURE.

A level is a general term meaning an amount of experience points attained by a PC through various adventures. **All player characters begin their first adventure at level 0**.

Enemies have levels as well. An enemy's level indicates how ferocious and difficult he or she is to battle in combat.
