1.	On a blank sheet of paper write down the names of the player character's primary traits: Strength, Intelligence, Perception, Dexterity, Vitality, Charisma and Magic. If an OA Character Record Sheet is being used, the seven names will already be printed on the record sheet. It may prove useful to look at the character record sheet (page 91) to better understand the form it takes.
2.	Read the section on character Primary Traits (page 6), Secondary Traits (page 7) and Archetypes (page 10), then choose an archetype that best suits your character. Optionally you may choose to Dual-Arch (choose two archetypes instead of one) by dividing all the traits listed for each archetype in half then adding the two archetypes together.
3.	Read the section on character Races & Species (page 12), then choose a race or species that best suits your character. Write down any bonuses or restrictions that race or species may possess.
4.	Choose one of the three Focus (page 16) your race or species has listed. Write down any bonuses or penalties the focus may possess.
5.	Pick a number of Feats (page 17) from the feats list of the race or species you chose in step 3. You may pick a number of feats equal to the number allowed by the archetype of your character.
6.	Roll 2d6 (for a result of 2-12) to find the number of Character Points (page 20) you add to your character's primary traits. No primary trait (except "magic") can have less than 1 point, and no primary trait can have more than 10 points total.
7.	Set aside a section of the paper for Experience Points (XP). As a new character, write down "0" for the amount of starting XP. Additionally, make a note of the amount of XP needed to advance to first level. Record any XP bonuses or penalties from having high or low primary trait numbers.
8.	Determine all of your character's secondary traits.
9.	Roll 2d6+3 (for a result of 5-15). This number represents the amount of currency your player character begins with and can use to purchase equipment before game play begins (see step 10 below). For medieval fantasy campaigns the standard currency is Silver Coins (SC). Science fiction campaigns use Star Credits (SC) as currency.
10.	Consult the tables of Weaponry, Armor and Expedition Equipment (starting on page 23) then "purchase" whatever gear your player character chooses-within the limits of his or her starting currency amount. Write down the equipment, weapons and armor your character purchased on the back of the paper. Deduct any money spent buying equipment.
11.	Now that you know what type of weaponry your character will be using, determine his or her Attack (ATK) trait by adding the weapon's damage rating to your character's strength-if the weapon is melee, or perception-if the weapon is ranged. Write the new number in a section marked "Attack".
12.	Find the character's Defense (DFS) trait by adding their dexterity trait to their armor's toughness rating. Write the new number in a section marked "Defense".
13.	Name your character and imagine a suitable personality, background story and role (a profession or social class). Give this step care, as once you've chosen a name and background they can rarely be changed!
