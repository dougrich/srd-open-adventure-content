# Primary Traits
Before creating a player character, it's important to understand a character's Primary Traits and what they represent.

Primary traits represent different characteristics of a PC. There are seven primary traits: strength, perception, intelligence, dexterity, charisma, vitality and magic. Primary traits are represented by a number of Character Points (CP) which denotes how powerful the character is in that particular trait.

Most characters will have approximately 30 CP, divided amongst six or seven primary traits (for an average of 5 character points per trait). During character creation no primary trait may have less than 1 point allocated to it (except the "magic" trait, see below) or more than 10 points placed into it. A primary trait with a value of "5" is considered average for a normal adult human.

### Optional Magic Trait
At the GM's discretion, paranormal powers of magic spells and psionic abilities may be disallowed in an adventure. If magic is prohibited, or a player does not wish for their adventurer to use magic, the magic trait should have 0 character points assigned to it.

For more information and a list of magic spells and psionics to choose from, see page 49.

The seven primary traits, and their significance, are explained hereafter:

### Strength (STR)
"Strength" is a measure of a character's muscular power and physical brawn. Player's who wish for their character to wield Melee Weapons proficiently such as a glaive or vibroaxe should have a high strength.

Strength directly influences a character's Melee Attack (page 10).

### Perception (PER)
"Perception" refers to eye-hand coordination, attention to detail and natural intuition. Perception aids in a player's ability to wield Ranged Weapons (including thrown weapons) such as a bow or laser pistol. A player who wants their character to be proficient with ranged or thrown weapons should give their character a high perception.

Perception directly influences a character's Initiative (see page 79) and Ranged Attack (see page 10).
 
### Intelligence (INT)
"Intelligence" is the ability to learn and remember knowledge. It is also a measure of a character's overall IQ and ability to solve mental problems. Players who wish for their characters to be multi-lingual, have excellent memory and reasoning skills and a strong will should have a high intelligence.

Intelligence directly influences the number of Languages Points (page 8) a character knows, and a character's Will Save (see page 9).

### Dexterity (DEX)
"Dexterity" refers to agility, flexibility and reflexes. A character with a high dexterity is good at Unarmed Attacks and dodging incoming threats. A player who wants their character to be quick, nimble and acrobatic should choose a high dexterity.

Dexterity directly influences a character's Unarmed Attacks (page 10), Defense (see page 10), and Reflex Save (page 9).

### Charisma (CHA)
"Charisma" is a combination of personal appearance, charm and leadership ability. A high charisma means many good Reactions from NPCs, which can help a player throughout the game. A player who wants a character who can succeed at social events should choose a high charisma.

Charisma directly influences the hiring price of Retainers (see page 34) and Reactions from NPCs when first meeting other characters.

### Vitality (VIT)
"Vitality" is a measure of the constitution, well-being and overall health of a character. A high vitality means many Health Points, making a character less likely to die or be killed. A player who wants a character who can sustain a lot of damage before succumbing to death should choose a high vitality.

Vitality directly influences the number of Health Points (see page 7), Stamina Points (see page 7) and a character's Fortitude Save (see page 9).

### Magic (MAG)
"Magic" is the innate ability for a character to harness unseen but potent supernatural powers. In a medieval fantasy campaign magic wielders tap into an arcane realm of occult possibility known as Spells. For a science fiction campaign, characters with Psionic powers can draw from a mysterious "paraforce".
