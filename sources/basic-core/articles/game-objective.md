# Object of the Game

In most games the concepts of "winning" and "losing" are important. However in OA these conditions do not apply! The players and game master do not play against each other, even though the GM does play the roles of the enemies that threaten the players. The job of the game master is to remain fair, neutral and not take sides. He or she acts as a guide or referee, the person who offers challenges for the players to overcome, keeps the action flowing and provides an exciting and daring adventure for the players.

Players have fun by overcoming daring obstacles, finding valuable treasures and solving complex puzzles as a team. But doing so does not mean the game has been "won". Likewise the game is not "lost" if a player's character perishes on some far off frontier. When a player character dies the controlling player can simply create a new character to later join the adventuring party and continue playing. A good OPEN ADVENTURE campaign is like a collaborative fantasy or science fiction novel, written by the players and GM alike.

The real way to "win" OA is to have fun. If you're enjoying the experience; you're doing something right. 

Below are step-by-step instructions on what players will need to do to create a new player character for the OPEN ADVENTURE game. In a two-person game, the player making a character should create and control at least two player characters, instead.
