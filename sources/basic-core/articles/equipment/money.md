# Money

Roll 2d6+3 to determine the amount of starting money for your PC in silver coins or star credits.

In OA, there are three types of currencies used when making trades or purchases. Copper Coins (CC) for fantasy or Core Credits (CC) for science fiction games, are the smallest denomination used for purchasing items and equipment. 100 CC is worth 1 Silver Coin (SC) for fantasy or Star Credit (SC) for sci-fi. 100 SC is worth 1 Gold Coin (GC) for fantasy or Galactic Credit (GC) for science fiction.
Before the game begins players roll 2d6+3 to determine the amount of currency (in SC, see below) their character begins with in the game. Use this money to purchase weaponry, armor, clothing, food and expedition equipment before the game begins.

All three types of currency are universally accepted almost anywhere there is commerce. Treasures found in the hinterlands or far reaches of space will always have a value given in either copper, silver or gold coins-or-in core, star or galactic credits.
