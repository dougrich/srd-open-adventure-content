# Weaponry

The weapons tables, beginning on page 25, show a basic list of starting weapons for sale. Weapon information in the tables below is as follows:

WEAPON NAME - Describes the basic type of weapon it is considered to be. Note that ranged weapons require ammunition to use, with one ammunition being spent per use. FOR EXAMPLE, a crossbow needs a quarrel to be fired in order to use the weapon.

COST - The amount of coins or credits that must be spent to purchase the weapon.

DAMAGE - A weapon's damage number is added to a character's strength or perception (depending on if the weapon is melee or ranged) to determine a character's attack number (see page 10 for details).

RANGE - The maximum number of spaces a ranged weapon can attack a distant target. This number will increase or decrease depending on the number of positive or negative modifiers from the attack roll. FOR EXAMPLE, a weapon with range 3 would be brought to range 5 with a +2 attack roll (3 + 2 = 5).

WEIGHT - The measure of how heavy the weapon is, in weight points. This is an optional trait that can be used according to the rules found in the INTERMEDIATE RULEBOOK. If only the basic rulebook is being used, this trait can be ignored.

HANDEDNESS - The number of hands required to wield the weapon. Weapons require either one or two hands to use. If the character does not have enough free hands to use the weapon, the weapon cannot be used.

ABILITIES - The effects a weapon can achieve during combat. Most abilities have a cost that must first be paid for the effect to resolve. See page 43 for ability details.

### Improvised Weapons
Common objects used during combat as Improvised Weapons deal 1 or 2 kinetic damage (if only one hand or two hands are needed to use it, respectively).
