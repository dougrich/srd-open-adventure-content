# Legacy Names
When characters reach the maximum experience level of level 5, they may choose a unique Legacy Name. Legacy names are special titles, names or aliases given to characters once they've been promoted to fifth level. Legacy names are added to a character's already-existing name. Once chosen, legacy names are permanent and cannot be changed later.

Legacy names take on the format of either "`<Character name> The <legacy name>" or "<Character name> of <legacy name>`". Legacy names are based upon the characters previous exploits in past adventures. For example "Tulen the goblin decapitator" or "Marin finder of the star forge temple".

Legacy names stay not just with the character, but the player as well. A player cannot choose the same legacy name twice (irrespective of different characters, campaigns, game groups etc.). Legacy names cannot be chosen if a player in the group has already chosen that name (either in the current game or a previous one).
